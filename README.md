# JSC370-project
This is the course project of JSC370 Data Science II.

The dataset used in this project is the [2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2022.html) collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The main question to be explored in this project is to find the risk factors that are most predictive of diabetes and predict whether an individual has diabetes.

The midterm.Rmd file and the knitted html contain the exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and some statistical analysis used to explore this question.
